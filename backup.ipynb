    "# Data-driven Approach to decide where to live in London\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Aims, objectives, and background\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1\tIntroduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thousands of people move homes every year in London, “24,970 people moved to a new home in the capital in the first half of the year (2021) compared to 9,440 in the same six months the year before (2020)” [1]. There are many factors involved in the decision-making process , one of the most important factors for people moving to a borough in London is the crime rate in the area, “Important factor to consider when you decide where to live is the safety of an area” [2]. Many people make decisions based on intuition, but this project takes a scientific data-driven approach to make an informed decision about living in a London borough based on the crime rate in the area. Data-driven decision making is defined as “the process of using data to inform your decision-making process and validate a course of action before committing to it.” [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2\tAims and objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project the following research questions are explored:\n",
    "- Is it possible to get access to reliable and consistent data about different crimes in each London borough?\n",
    "- Using data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "    1. Can all London boroughs be compared to each other for a specific crime over a period of time?\n",
    "    2. Since population of each London borough is different so can all London boroughs be compared to each other for a specific crime per person (per capita crime) over a period of time?\n",
    "    3. How different categories of crimes compare to each other in a specific London borough over a period of time? \n",
    "    4. And more importantly, can the trend of any given crime be compared to the trend of another crime in a specific London borough over a period of time?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the aims are as follows:\n",
    "1.\tSince credibility of organization that provides data is critical for the decision-making process so finding a reliable organization that can as data source to provides consistent data. \n",
    "2.\tTaking into consideration constraints on time and resource, decide on how much data is required to sufficiently explore the above questions.\n",
    "3.\tCollect the data and store in a form which allows for data cleaning and analysis.\n",
    "4.\tClean and transform the data such that it is suitable to create visualizations.\n",
    "5.\tUse visualisations to carry out exploratory data analysis, resulting in clear decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3\tProject Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Literature review of research papers showed that there is lot of research in crime prevention and impact of crime on different aspects of human life, but no research could be found that focuses on using crime data to develop a data-driven decision-making approach to choose where to live so it makes perfect sense to work in this area of research. Further as the following screenshot shows, ‘Your area’ tool provided on https://www.police.uk/ does not show many important matrices that are covered by this project, that is, overall per capita comparison for a specific crime among different boroughs, trend of a list of crimes in any specific borough. This means that the project brings additional insight into data that is not available on the official police website. \n",
